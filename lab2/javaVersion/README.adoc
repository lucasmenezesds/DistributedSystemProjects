. Multithread Circle:

.. Write a program that creates 30 threads and has a message circulate between them.

.. The message is a random string with at least 80 characters

.. Each time a thread receives the message it prints it, modifies the first lowercase character to uppercase, if it exists, sleeps for 1 second, and passes the message.

.. When all characters are uppercase, the process passes the message and then ends.

.. Before finishing, the process must print the resulting message.
